The organization provides consumer products in emerging markets using a pay-as-you-go model. Customers typically pay a portion of the product price upfront (deposit/down payment) and then complete the purchase through small daily installment payments (follow-on payments).

There are two primary goals for this business model:

1.Drive product sales.

2.Ensure full collection of follow-on payments.
